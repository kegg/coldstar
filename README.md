ColdFusion MVC Framework

Introduction
------------

So a while ago, I wanted to create my own MVC Framework. So I did. I figured it would be best to just create one that is simple and uses CFCs for the main everything. As this project currently stands, it was more of a see if this will work type of thing. It can, and should be, improved upon.
